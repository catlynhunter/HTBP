        "- **`camelCase`**: The first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., `myVariableName`).\n",
        "- **`PascalCase`**: All words start with an uppercase letter (e.g., `MyClassName`). Often used for class names in Python.\n",
        "- **`kebab-case`**: Words are lowercase and separated by hyphens (e.g., `my-file-name`). Used in web development (HTML/CSS) but **not for Python variable names**.\n",

        "- `age`\n",
        "- `total_score`\n",
        "- `firstName` (camelCase is also sometimes seen, though snake_case is preferred in Python)\n",
        "- `MAX_ATTEMPTS` (constants - values that don't change, often in all caps with underscores)\n",

        "❌ **BAD variable names:**\n",
        "- `2students` - Can't start with a number\n",
        "- `student-name` - No hyphens allowed\n",
        "- `student name` - No spaces allowed\n",
        "- `class` - Can't use Python keywords (reserved words)\n",
